loaf-tags
=========
Although there is nothing here now,we will later add some custom html tags that should be used for blogs or soical media sites.
We now have the "tags" tag for tags in blog posts!
We now have the .trans class used to make transparent menu's. all you have to do is add the class .trans(Then a number 1-9 here. 1 is the most transparent and 9 is the least. we recomend 6)
we also have the blubtn tag that adds a styleish flat blue button to your webpage.
